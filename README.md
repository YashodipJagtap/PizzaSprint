## 📖 Description  

This project served as an introduction to **NoSQL**, **MongoDB**, and the **Mongoose ODM** technologies. I created a web app that allows users to create and save their own custom pizza recipes using MongoDB as the database. Users can also view other users' pizza recipes and leave comments on them. The app utilizes MongoDB's flexible schema and scalability to efficiently handle and store large amounts of recipe and user data.
